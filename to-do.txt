okay what are the things that I need to do now:
- make a widget
- make the input require stuff before it adds
- can I use a permission so battery usage doesnt block my stuff?

Widget needs:
- Make it so that it updates based on what workout is available today, 
not just updating every time I update the workout
- Use todayWorkouts? - Right now it just shows the first one 
- Put streak on widget


How to make a widget:
- Meta data for widget (in Widgetinfo.xml)
- Widget layout
- Connect in manifest xml
- Where does widget connect the workout ID to the widget




- AppWidgetProvider -KT widget provide
React Bridge: 
- AppWidgetModule
- AppWidgetPAckage - in main application
